*Neurolito Agent* can be installed in different ways. One is as a Linux container that also contains
*Ollama*, which runs on Windows (Docker Desktop), Linux and macOS. Another is to install using
Chocolatey and run as a Windows service.

## Install with Chocolatey
You need [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) on the
machine. Nothing else - the package is self-contained, so the .NET runtime does not have to be installed.

The agent package is served by Neurolito itself, and the command carries **your team's install key**, so a
download can be attributed to your team and a key revoked without disturbing anyone else. Sign in and open
the [install guide](https://neurolito.com/install-agent); it shows the two commands filled in and ready to
copy:

```powershell
choco source add -n=neurolito -s="https://neurolito.com/nuget/v3/index.json" -u="<your team>" -p="<your key>" --priority=1
choco install neurolito-agent -y -s neurolito
```

Registering the source stores the key on the machine, so later upgrades need no credential at all:

```powershell
choco upgrade neurolito-agent -y
```

The source needs no credential once the feed allows anonymous read. Until then it does, which is why
the install guide is the place that stays current.

## Install as a container
The image is built from `Dockerfile`: `ollama/ollama` with the ASP.NET Core runtime and the agent on
top, started by `start.sh` (Ollama first, then the agent once Ollama answers). It is served to teams
through the site's registry at `/v2/`, behind the team's install key, and the
[install guide](https://neurolito.com/install-agent) shows the `docker login` and `docker run` commands
filled in. On Windows, `install.agent.ps1` at the root of this repository does the same from PowerShell.

The container reads its settings from the environment:

| Variable | Why |
|---|---|
| `Tharga__Communication__ApiKey` | The team install key. Without it the agent connects unassigned and runs nothing. |
| `Tharga__Communication__ServerAddress` | The server to join. Defaults to `https://neurolito.com/` in Production. |
| `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:5000` | Required - Kestrel otherwise binds to `localhost` inside the container. |

Mount a volume at `/root/.ollama` so models survive an upgrade, and pass `--gpus all` to use an NVIDIA
card.

## Running the agent
The agent can be run in several ways.

### Local Agent in docker
From the root of the repository run `.\install.agent.ps1 -NoPull`. It builds the image from source and
starts it; the agent answers on [http://localhost:5101/swagger/](http://localhost:5101/swagger/).

### Local Agent native
From the root of the repository run
`$env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = "Production"; dotnet run --project .\Tharga.Neurolito.Agent\Tharga.Neurolito.Agent.csproj --launch-profile https`

## Building Chocolatey package
In the `Tharga.Neurolito.Agent` folder run...
- `.\Resources\pack-choco.ps1` to build the package
- `choco install neurolito-agent --version="1.0.1" --source=".\choco-temp" -y` to install the package
- Go to [http://localhost:5001/swagger/](http://localhost:5001/swagger/)

---

## Running from Visual Studio
- Have *ollama* running separatley on port 11434.
- Start the agent using https (or http) and access it here
- [https://localhost:7200/swagger/](https://localhost:7200/swagger/)
- [http://localhost:5015/swagger/](http://localhost:5015/swagger/)

### Install Ollama in docker
- `docker pull ollama/ollama:latest`
- `docker rm -f ollama 2>$null`

#### Start Ollama without GPU
`docker run -d --name ollama -p 11434:11434 -v ollama:/root/.ollama ollama/ollama:latest`

#### Start Ollama with GPU
`docker run -d --name ollama --gpus all -p 11434:11434 -v ollama:/root/.ollama ollama/ollama:latest`
